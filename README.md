# 🤖 AI Chatbot, PDF Summarizer & Image Generator  

## 📌 Description  
This project includes three AI-powered applications built using **OpenAI API** and **Streamlit**:  
1. **Chatbot for PDF Summarization** - A chatbot that summarizes and answers questions based on uploaded PDFs.  
2. **AI Image Generator** - Generates images from text descriptions using OpenAI's image API.  
3. **Multiple PDF Summarizer** - Extracts key insights from multiple PDFs using AI summarization.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Chatbot for PDFs** - Upload PDFs and interact with AI to get summaries.  
✅ **AI Image Generator** - Generate images from text prompts.  
✅ **PDF Summarizer** - Automatically condense multiple PDFs into short summaries.  
✅ **Built with OpenAI API** - No local ML models; all processing is API-driven.  
✅ **User-Friendly UI** - Powered by Streamlit for easy interaction.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-3.5 for chat & summaries, DALL·E for images)  
- **Streamlit** (Web UI)  
- **LangChain** (For document processing)
